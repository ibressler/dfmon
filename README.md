### About

Its creation was motivated by the need to hot-unplug (e)SATA hard disks from the
running system. Recent Linux distributions support this (via a GUI) for USB 
devices but not for SATA devices directly, afaik (the author). Please tell me,
if I'm wrong, or if this is not supported by the kernel at all.

Device removal preparation follows [a guide from Redhat] [1]. Except for LVM,
md or multipath setups - to keep it simple for the beginning.

### Invokation

The GUI is invoked like so:

	$ python dfmon.py

### Requirements

* Python
* Qt
* PyQt

Tested on Ubuntu 11, OpenSuse 12, Fedora 16

#### Ubuntu

	$ sudo apt-get install python-qt4

#### Fedora

	$ su
	# yum install PyQt4

#### OpenSuse

If you use the KDE Desktop, PyQt is already installed, but it won't hurt:

	$ su
	# zypper install python-qt4

### Personal Note

This tiny project serves also for getting familiar with python itself. Hence,
feel free to point me at problems, give suggestions or provide patches ;)

### Copying

Qt dependencies are restricted to dfmonQt. dfmonCmd as well as dfmonBackend
are free of Qt. Therefore, it should be possible to write a different GUI, if
someone dislikes Qt. Additionally, the backend could be licensed 'more free', if
there is interest.
