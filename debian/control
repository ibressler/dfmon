Description: A GUI for managing hotplug storage devices with Truecrypt support.
 dfmon is a program that hot-unplugs (e)SATA hard disks from the running system. At the time of creation of this tool, recent linux distributions did support this via a GUI for USB devices but not for SATA devices directly. This is required for swapping external (e)SATA hard disks without reboot and/or re-logon.
